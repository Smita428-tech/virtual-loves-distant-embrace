        <h2>A Poem for Missing Loved Ones</h2>
        <div class="poem">
            <p class="poem-line">In days of old, when distance stretched its hand,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">And loved ones dwelled in distant, far-off lands,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">The ache of separation gripped the heart,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">With no swift means to bridge the miles apart.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Oh, how they yearned, those souls of yore,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">To touch a cheek, to hold one close once more,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">No screens to flicker faces, bright and clear,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">No virtual embrace to quell their tears.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">They wrote their words upon parchment dear,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">In ink-stained letters, whispers of love sincere,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Each stroke of pen a bridge, though fragile, true,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">A lifeline woven through the ocean's blue.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Their hearts, resilient, forged in iron and fire,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Withstanding time, distance, and its cruel attire,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">They longed for a touch, a presence near,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">While destiny played games, their souls held dear.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Yet let us cherish this digital age we live,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Where love can reach across the globe, forgive</p>
            <p class="poem-line">The limitations that once bound our fate,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Now memories and moments need not wait.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">For in this era, blessed with wondrous charms,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">We hold the power to connect, in each other's arms,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Through screens and pixels, love's song still sings,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Though miles may part, our hearts take flight on wings.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">So, as you miss your friend, so far away,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Remember, you're blessed with means to convey</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Your love and longing through the virtual sphere,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">And cherish the gift of connection, my dear.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">In every touch of key, every virtual embrace,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">Let gratitude bloom, filling every space,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">For those who came before, their hearts held fast,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">And paved the way for this love to last.</p>
            <p class="poem-line">In this vast expanse of digital domain,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">May love's sweet presence forever remain,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">And in your heart, hold dear the joys anew,</p>
            <p class="poem-line">For bridging distances, connecting me to you.</p>
